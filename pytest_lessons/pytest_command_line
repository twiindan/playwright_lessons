You can run a single test file:

    pytest <filename>

Also is possible run a whole directory

    pytest <directory>

If you want to execute tests by keyword expression:

    pytest -k <keyword>

    For example

    pytest -k 'test_initial_check'
    pytest -k 'TestClass'

To run a specific test:

    pytest 01_test_pytest_basics.py::test_initialCheck

To run a specific Test Class:
    pytest 04_test_pytest_fixtures_scopes_2.py::TestClass

To run a test inside a Test Class:
    pytest 04_test_pytest_fixtures_scopes_2.py::TestClass::test_second_class_check

To run a test with some mark:
    pytest <filename or directory> -m <tag>

Print the output during tests:
    pytest -s
